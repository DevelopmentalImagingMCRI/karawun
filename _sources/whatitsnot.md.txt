# What it doesn't do

We have not tested the compatibility of DICOM files generated by *Karawun* with
picture archiving and communication systems (PACS).

*Karawun* does not generate DICOM files for storing DWI data. This means that
you cannot, for example, correct DWI data with topup, convert to DICOM and
import the results into Brainlab to test the impact on Brainlab's internal
tractography tools.
